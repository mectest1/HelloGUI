Q: How to launch FX Window Without CMD Window?
A: As you can see, you can fill within batch files this command to launch FX Application directly:
	[start /c] "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_65\bin\javaw" -jar app/HelloUtility.jar
	But it will show a CMD window after all.
	
	 To get rid of this, you can use Inno Setup or Launch4j to patch
	this java program into a native application. 
	
	However, there is also another quick hack in Windows to run you application without CMD window.
	And here are the steps:
	1, Create a shortcut in any folder, and open its properties window;
	2, Set its "Target" as javaw.exe; you can append any parameters here; 
	3, Set "Start In" as current directory;
	4, Click "Change Icon" to set an icon for this shortcut;
	
	e.g.:
	1, Target: "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_65\bin\javaw.exe" -jar app/HelloUtility.jar
	2, Start In: "C:\Programs\Utility 3000 in One"
	3, Icon:
